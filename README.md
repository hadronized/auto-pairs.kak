# auto-pairs

This repository holds a simple implementation of _auto pairs_ for Kakoune. It supports two main features:

- Adding an opening delimiter automatically inserts its closing variant.
- Passing over delimiters in insert mode; in theory, it works with any character.

This is still experimental; have fun.
